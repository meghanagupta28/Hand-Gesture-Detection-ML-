# Hand-Gesture-Detection-ML-

Sign language is an important means of communication for people with hearing impairments. This repository demonstrates the implementation of a machine learning model to recognize hand gestures, making it possible to bridge the communication gap.

The model utilizes a custom CNN model trained on the American Sign Language (ASL) Alphabet dataset. The dataset present in the repository is a preprocessed dataset.

### Installation

The repository can be cloned
```git clone https://github.com/meghanagupta28/Hand-Gesture-Detection-ML-``` 

The model requires that python be installed in the system

If the conditions meet, install the required dependancies
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Running 

The model code is in the form of a notebook and can hence be simply downloaded and run on the system after installation of the prerequisites.

The saved model in the repository can be run from the cell 43 of the notebook. 

### Results

The model has a test accuracy of 98.93% and has high precision and recall.
