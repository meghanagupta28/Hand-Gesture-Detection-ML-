# Hand-Gesture-Detection-ML-

Sign language is an important means of communication for people with hearing impairments. This repository demonstrates the implementation of a machine learning model to recognize hand gestures, making it possible to bridge the communication gap.

The model utilizes a custom CNN model trained on the American Sign Language (ASL) Alphabet dataset. The dataset present in the repository is a preprocessed dataset.

### Installation

The repository can be cloned
```git clone https://github.com/meghanagupta28/Hand-Gesture-Detection-ML-``` 

The model requires that python be installed in the system

If the conditions meet, install the required dependancies
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Running 

The model code is in the form of a notebook and can hence be simply downloaded and run on the system after installation of the prerequisites.

### Results

The model has a test accuracy of 92.05% and has high precision and recall.
